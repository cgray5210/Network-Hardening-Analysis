# Network Hardening Analysis Lab

## Objective

This project involved conducting a security risk assessment for a social media organization following a data breach that exposed customers' personal information. Key tasks included analyzing the incident, identifying critical vulnerabilities such as weak password practices, default admin credentials, lack of firewall rules, and absence of multifactor authentication (MFA). The assessment focused on recommending network hardening measures to mitigate risks and enhance the organization's overall security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Conducting comprehensive security risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities in network infrastructure.
- Analyzing real-world cybersecurity incidents to determine root causes and recommend preventative measures.
- Strengthening knowledge of password security, including enforcing unique and non-default credentials.
- Enhancing understanding of firewall configuration and traffic filtering to protect network boundaries.
- Implementing multifactor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security against unauthorized access.
- Developing actionable recommendations to harden networks and prevent future data breaches.
- Strengthened problem-solving and critical-thinking skills to address complex security challenges.


### Tools Used

- Risk assessment frameworks for identifying and analyzing network vulnerabilities.
- Policy management tools for enforcing password security and uniqueness.
- Firewall configuration utilities for creating and applying traffic filtering rules.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) platforms to enhance user verification processes.
- Documentation tools to record security assessments, findings, and mitigation strategies.
- Network monitoring systems to detect and analyze potential security threats.
